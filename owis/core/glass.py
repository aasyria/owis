# this script will look to all network traffic for a Ip address
# and give us highly relevant information like username and password from his http communication in the internet .
# the information should be Human readable.
#TODO :
# create or find a tool like nmap or wireshark cli to scan and look to all network traffic
# the script looking only for http and not encrypted communication
# fetch the bits from the package request
# calculate and convert to ASCII and make it Human readable
# save it in dictionaries with the ip address.
